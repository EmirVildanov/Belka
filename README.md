### About

This application supposed to an application for students of SPbU<sup>[2]</sup> who live in the PUNK<sup>[3]</sup>
dormitory and usually travel to town by suburban train. It would give them an opportunity to find an interlocutor for a
40-50 minutes ride in two directions:

* From PUNK to town
* From town to PUNK

After some code was written the idea of application of more wide use came up. Why to limit yourself with a suburban
train when you can find an interlocutor in any kind of public transport or even pedestrian walk. Everything you have to
do is to choose a route, transport, time and create an application for other people to join you (much like you do in
BlaBlaCar, for example).

#### Note

[1] Elka -- Russian slang name of suburban train.  
[2] SPbU -- St Petersburg University.  
[3] PUNK -- Petrodvorets Educational and Scientific Complex of SPbU.

### Rules

* User have to fill an account info with following information:
    * ðŸ‘¤ Name
    * ðŸ‘¥ Surname (optionally)
    * ðŸ”¢ Age
    * ðŸ—’ Small about section
    * ðŸ“¸ Photo (optionally)
* There works a rating system: users leave a rate and write a meaningful feedback about the interlocutor he/she was
  matched with. User may leave feedback in two cases:
    * When the application succeeded and there was a match between two users. User must add feedback after every
      succeeded match. **If user doesn't leave a feedback, it's rating downsizing**;
    * While analyzing other user's profile in two cases:
        * Analyzing existed application;
        * Analyzing request for accepting his/her application.

      This feedback will override the old one in case it exist.
* Every route has two points: FROM and TO. Both of these points have their identification ids. There are 2 types of
  routes in the app:
    * Fetched by Yandex Rasp API. They are the one you can choose from the list;
    * User created.

  Pedestrian application is the only one where FROM and TO points may coincide.
* It **would** be great to have an opportunity to subscribe on new applications updates, so you don't miss an
  opportunity.

### TODO:

- [ ] Update .sh so it creates accounts database on machine
- [ ] data/db dir must be created in the root folder: `sudo chmod -R go+w /data/db`
- [ ] [look at course on kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)
- [ ] configure kubernetes
- [ ] 
  From [Docker security tips](https://blog.aquasec.com/docker-security-best-practices): [run the docker container as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)
- [ ] [pass configs to image through secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)

### Architecture

* **KotlinTelegramBot** for bot frontend
* **MongoDb** for storing data
* **Ktor** for http requests
* ??? **Redis** for storing applications info ???
* **Yandex Rasp API** for fetching rides info. On first request <FROM-TO> in a day it stores information in db (cache?).

### Development

* Call `./gradlew ktlintCheck` (`./gradlew ktlintFormat` in help) before pushing code to repository

### Dev links:

Lucid app gives limited number of elements on diagram for non-premium users. That's why there are two diagrams: one for
main and one for side logic.
